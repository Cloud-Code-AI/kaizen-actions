# Kaizen Unit Test Runner

This GitHub Action runs unit tests generated by Kaizen for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React projects.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Run Kaizen unit tests
  uses: Cloud-Code-AI/kaizen-unittest-runner-action@v1.0.1
  with:
    python-version: '3.x'  # optional, default is '3.x'
```

## Inputs

- `python-version`: The version of Python to use (default: '3.x')

Note: This action uses the latest version of Node.js by default.

## How it works

This action uses the `kaizen-cli` to run Python unit tests located in the `.kaizen/unittests` directory. For JavaScript, TypeScript, and React projects, it uses the following test runners:

- JavaScript and TypeScript tests are run using `jest`
- React tests are run using `react-scripts test`

The action supports both `poetry` and `requirements.txt` for Python projects.
